  # Explanation of Shortest Path Finding Algorithm using Dijkstra's Algorithm

The provided code implements a graph data structure and a method to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. Below is a breakdown of the code:

### Graph Class
- The `Graph` class is defined to represent a graph data structure.
- The constructor `__init__` initializes the graph with an empty dictionary to store nodes and their neighbors.
- The `add_node` method adds a node to the graph with its list of neighbors along with the edge weights.

### Shortest Path Finding Method
- The `shortest_path` method takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, representing the starting and ending nodes for which the shortest path needs to be found.
- Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `end` node in the graph.
- It maintains a priority queue `queue` to keep track of nodes to visit based on their current cost.
- The `distances` dictionary stores the shortest distance found so far from the `start` node to each node.
- The `previous` dictionary keeps track of the previous node in the shortest path to each node.
- The algorithm iterates through the nodes in the graph, updating the distances and previous nodes as it explores the graph.
- Finally, it reconstructs the shortest path from `start` to `end` using the `previous` dictionary.

### Example Usage
- In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, a sample graph is created with nodes A to F and their respective neighbors with edge weights.
- The `shortest_path` method is called with the starting node "A" and the ending node "F" to find the shortest path between them.
- The result is printed out, showing the shortest path from node A to node F.

### External Dependencies
- The code uses the `heapq` module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm (priority queue) for efficient retrieval of the minimum element.

### Example Output
```
Shortest path from A to F: ['A', 'C', 'B', 'D', 'F']
```

This output indicates that the shortest path from node A to node F in the provided graph is A -> C -> B -> D -> F.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  import heapq

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}

    def add_node(self, label, neighbors):
        self.nodes[label] = neighbors

    def shortest_path(self, start, end):
        queue = [(0, start)]
        distances = {node: float('inf') for node in self.nodes}
        distances[start] = 0
        previous = {node: None for node in self.nodes}
        visited = set()

        while queue:
            current_cost, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)

            if current_node in visited:
                continue

            visited.add(current_node)

            for neighbor, cost in self.nodes[current_node]:
                if neighbor in visited:
                    continue

                new_cost = current_cost + cost
                if new_cost < distances[neighbor]:
                    distances[neighbor] = new_cost
                    previous[neighbor] = current_node
                    heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, neighbor))

        path = []
        at = end
        while at is not None:
            path.append(at)
            at = previous[at]

        return path[::-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    graph = Graph()
    graph.add_node("A", [("B", 4), ("C", 2)])
    graph.add_node("B", [("A", 4), ("C", 1), ("D", 5)])
    graph.add_node("C", [("A", 2), ("B", 1), ("D", 8), ("E", 10)])
    graph.add_node("D", [("B", 5), ("C", 8), ("E", 2), ("F", 6)])
    graph.add_node("E", [("C", 10), ("D", 2), ("F", 3)])
    graph.add_node("F", [("D", 6), ("E", 3)])

    print("Shortest path from A to F:", graph.shortest_path("A", "F"))
  ```
